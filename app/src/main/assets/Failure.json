It is just idiotic to criminalise any substance, I think.","author":"Rhys Ifans","topic":"Failure"},{"quote":"It&#39;s a strange failure of the literary world that Updike never quite received his due. Despite winning two Pulitzers and two National Book Awards and countless other awards and honours, he was denied the Nobel.","author":"Justin Cartwright","topic":"Failure"},{"quote":"Lincoln made mistakes. Roosevelt made mistakes. Eisenhower made mistakes. The Battle of the Bulge was the biggest intelligence failure in American military history, much bigger than any in Vietnam or now.

They live their lives in the public eye and get off on it, they need it. They need that kind of adoration.

Basically, if I had not failed, I&#39;d have been a lawyer and there would be no Spanx. I think failure is nothing more than life&#39;s way of nudging you that you are off course. My attitude to failure is not attached to outcome, but in not trying. It is liberating.","author":"Sara Blakely","topic":"Failure"},{"quote":"I get asked, &#39;How can you have such failures in your films?&#39; Well, what else is life about? There&#39;s some sense of constant failure in something. Humor gives you a distance from it.","author":"Alexander Payne","topic":"Failure"},{"quote":"So nevertheless, what I&#39;m saying is that what one is - one&#39;s parameters are constantly narrowed by one&#39;s success, and my desire is to widen my field even if I risk failure.","author":"Jeremy Irons","topic":"Failure"},{"quote":"I think everyone shares a fear of failure - that you&#39;re only as good as your most recent collection. That&#39;s definitely a fear, but it&#39;s a fear that fuels me, that makes me want to work harder, that makes me take on more challenges.","author":"Alexander Wang","topic":"Failure"},{"quote":"I think, if you&#39;re in the United States, we&#39;ve seen people trying to speak out in different ways and trying to make themselves heard about the United States&#39; failure to move on generationally, given the long-festering wound of our history around race.","author":"Joshua Oppenheimer","topic":"Failure"},{"quote":"Radical common sense is the wisdom gleaned from the past that recognizes the perishable opportunities of the moment. It is the willingness to admit error and the refusal to be deterred by failure.","author":"Marilyn Ferguson","topic":"Failure"},{"quote":"I was taught you don&#39;t tell your secrets to strangers - certainly not secrets that expose error, weakness, failure. My generation, like its predecessors, was taught that since our achievements received little notice or credit from white America, we were not to discuss our faults, lapses, or uncertainties in public.","author":"Margo Jefferson","topic":"Failure"},{"quote":"Exercise, from a public health perspective, is an unmitigated failure. The world&#39;s longest-lived people live in environments that nudge them into more movement.
